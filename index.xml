Good afternoon and welcome aboard to Eagle airlines! This is your captain speaking. The duration of this flight will be approximately seven hours from Shanghai to New York. A special welcome to our first class passengers, we have a full course meal from our very own Michelin starred chef, a unique collection of exclusive alcohols to ease your mind, and a porthole where you can view with your own eyes the natural splendor of the Himalayan mountains as we pass over.</description></item></channel></rss>
